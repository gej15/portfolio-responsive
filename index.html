        <p id="para">My name is Grant Jackson. I'm from Crystal Lake IL, about one hour northwest of Chicago.
                I moved to Austin in the summer of 2013. I have been working in the restaurant industry since high school and have a degree in culinary degree. I  have held many positions from line cook to general manager but my favorite was bartending on sixth street. Deciding that I needed a career change Iâ€™m moving on to computer science. I have been married for a little over one and a half years to my lovely wife Lauren. We have 2 dogs, Lando an Australian shepherd, and Eva a husky mix. They are our fur babies and we love them very much.
